# CodeSnippets
##### This is code snippets for Objective-C.

* ### Usage

  1. First go to the directory. 

     ```shell
     $ cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData
     ```

  2. Then clone the whole repo into local. 

     Make sure that there is no directory with the same name `CodeSnippets`. If exists, save the contents in that directory and paste them back into the `CodeSnippets` directory after clone.

     ```shell
     $ git clone git@github.com:archmagees/CodeSnippets.git
     ```

  3. Restart the Xcode. Now you can use the added code snippets.
